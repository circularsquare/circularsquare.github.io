its pretty cool, right? 

at some point i started thinking a lot about making a website to document all of myself. if i write down everything, i will exist for as long as the writing exists. 

i started with raw html, but then i switched over to jekyll which is very nice! it's very well documented and easy to use.

jekyll comes ready with the features needed to make a blog. blogs are linear and straight forward to read. but people are webs more than they are lines, and since the point of this website is just to write myself down, i mostly just use links, and try to forgo references to [time](/thoughts/time).
