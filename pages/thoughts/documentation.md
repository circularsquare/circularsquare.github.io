memory was good, until people decided they needed to remember more things, and for longer, so they invented writing. then memory got worse.

writing was good, until people decided they need to remember more things, so they invented computers and digital storage media. then people stopped writing as much.

the hard drives got bigger, and the clouds got easier to use. people put more and more of their lives into the ether, retrievable hopefully forever. people flushed the memories out of their mind, clearing space for more thoughts.

AI got better. people start to flush the thoughts out of their mind, into the ether, retrievable hopefully forever. clearing space?

[this website](/projects/site) is me partaking in documentation, flushing the memories out of my mind. i do it because it looks satisfying and satisfies my exhibitionist urge. but i do worry a bit that it's making me emptier. oh well.

isn't a long list so satisfying? [watercress](/friends/watercress) put me on lists. we made lists of where we wanted to go, of who we were. in high school, one time i wanted to make a list of literally everything. it's only forty pages long though. at the time, i did not have the attention i do now. this website is longer than forty pages, and it's mostly just about me.
