coding is an art. 

i am not good at doing art.
 - i get distracted without a clear goal
 - i rarely feel creative surges
 - i "don't have enough time"

but i'm trying it anyways. because there's so many people who have created so much. i want to make a mark, and this is the best way how, right?

and to be honest, i think things like the simulations i've made are actually not bad. with a little more dedication, they could become something

and that would be good. although maybe nothing i make will ever feel good. and that's a good thing, because once i truly feel good about something i've made, i'll have less drive to keep making things. is this strategy of making myself feel bad a good strategy? it's worked in the past...

i must.

## ai

i use cursor now. it's really good. [plum](friends/plum) actually told me that he hit a point where using ai code assistants actually decreased his productivity. i wonder if i've hit that point already. haha i can't think for myself lol
