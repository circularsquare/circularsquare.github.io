as i write this, i'm feeling very full, which makes it a bit hard to think.

food is kinda scary, because if you have too little of it you die. but if you have too much, it [dulls](/thoughts/fidelity).

and isn't food so [ugly](/thoughts/beauty)? an human ends so many smaller beings just to sustain its grotesque structure every day. it's the stuff of nightmares for someone like a [bunny](/friends/nanachimitty) or a plant.

the only solutions are suicide or fruitarianism. only eating the parts of a plant that are voluntarily given, intended to be eaten. but [freesia](/friends/freesia) said that steve jobs did that and it gave him cancer, so i guess that won't work.
