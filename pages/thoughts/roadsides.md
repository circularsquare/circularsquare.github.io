i often find myself sitting or standing on roads. listening to cars scream by like violent wavelets. when i am most afraid of people and of my voice, i come to these places.

in [clouds](/places/clouds), it was under the bridge to the mainland. in [sanba](/places/lakta), it was on the highway overpass under the streetlamp at the foot of the mountains. in [seybrook](/places/seybrook), it's the drawbridge over the smelly canal. in [kozuloa](/places/kozuloa), it's the ventilation shafts of the tunnel to [jornor](/places/jornor). at each of these places, i can be something like [alone](/thoughts/aloneness), but different, since even i am drowned out. zero's company. one's a crowd. i go to these forsaken places to remember my position in the world. to return to my type state, more alone than alone. 

it's comforting.

i love being in the presence of these big structures because it makes me feel small. being big is a lot of pressure. your details are on display for smaller creatures like ants or [bunnies](/anita/bunnies) to notice, even if you don't notice yourself. but if you are small, there is no pressure. sitting inside a bridge, atop a mountain, lost in a city, no one will see you. certainly, no one will be able to make out your [features](/thoughts/passing). your body becomes of no consequence.
