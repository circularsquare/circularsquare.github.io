everything [normalizes](/thoughts/normalness). everything returns to equilibrium.

happiness should be cherished, but it cannot last forever, because the mind will adjust the happiness to neutral.

depression and sadness will pass. if they are not allowed to take over, the mind will adjust to neutral.

productivity, stagnation, love, loneliness, life

in each of these respects, the mean of the distribution function is the same. we can control only the shape. 

for me, i'd like to experience the happiest moments possible. i allow most of my time to be spent sad and [alone](/thoughts/aloneness), so that the moments of joy are richer than anyone else's.

is this just an excuse for weakness? yeah. but i think it's a pretty good excuse lol.
