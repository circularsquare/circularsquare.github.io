so this is a thought that i don't have anymore because i think it's pretty terrible. but well into high school it was how i thought about justice. (nowadays, i don't really think about justice at all, which i think is good.) it goes like this:

- people don't have free will, so no one is responsible for their decisions
- justice requires that the quality of people's circumstances correspond to their freely made decisions
- in reality, some people live in better conditions than others
- so to enforce justice you should hurt people with nice lives and help people with not nice lives

sorta like robin hood but for happiness instead of money. and so i would go about my life being hostile toward anyone i thought was happy.
