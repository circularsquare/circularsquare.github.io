winter is [cold](/thoughts/temperature). where i am in [melissa](/places/melissa), the seasons are very pronounced as the milean sea gyre [strengthens](/thoughts/momentum) in winter, bringing cold northern water to the coast of melissa, and sea ice to fuun. 

winter's momentum permeates all aspects of life. winter is a time for spiraling into [aloneness](/thoughts/aloneness) or [productivity](/thoughts/achievement) or vitamin D deficiency or anything else. this is something that [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum) embraces beautifully.

winter is [beautiful](/thoughts/beauty), but primarily in how painful it is, and in the relief that it imparts onto the other seasons in conrtast. winter is my least favorite season since i became [cold](/thoughts/temperature). i used to never get sick, and i wore the same thin coat every day through the colder half of the year, but now that i'm cold i get sick four times a winter. but still, i recognize that winter is the most important season, the one that defines all the other ones. 

the first of my [friends](/friends) to emerge after the peak of winter are [forsythia](/friends/forsythia) and [plum](/friends/plum), who bloom before they grow leaves, which i'm thankful for.

[clementine](/friends/clementine) gave me a book called The Gardener's Year which talks about winter as a time of worry and preparation. but every season is a time of worry for the gardener.
