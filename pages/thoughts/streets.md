here are my 10 least favorite and 10 favorite streets.

| name | location | comments |
| canal st | manhattan | this is literally the worst street in the world. it is 6 lanes and they are always all full, since it's the only way from the lincoln tunnel to the manhattan bridge. crossing the street requires intimacy with cars. in the middle section, I <3 NY stores shine blinding white lights all the time. the sidewalks are very narrow. the fruit vendors take up quite a bit of the space and tourists take up a lot of the rest of the space, and neither of them get value from the other, it is wasted co-incidence. i think they should turn this street back into a canal.
| kissena blvd | queens | this was the first street i learned the name of. it was here that i invented the idea of walking. i had been driven the 15 minutes to flushing before, but what if i simply... went down kissena blvd? they thought i was crazy. they said it couldn't be done. i stewed over it for many years, waiting until the time was ripe. i showed them. whos laughing now.
| houston st | manhattan | this street is good because it lets you pronounce the city of houston wrong and be like oh sorry lol i'm just from new york it's just a new york thing lol.
| 8th ave | brooklyn | this is the most chinese street in the world.
| park ave | manhattan | i don't think anything of any relevance to anyone in my life has happened here, which is amazing given how much of manhattan it takes up. it's the width of a highway and has the vibe of one, but doesn't function that well as one because of the parking and the median.
| broadway | manhattan | there are *19* chipotles on broadway. amazing
| cross bay blvd | queens | it's biking on roads like this that convinced me to grow my hair long
| northern blvd | queens | such good korean food. it's also satisfying how long it is. if only it was slightly less of a highway...
| 125th st | manhattan | 125th st is the 14th st of harlem.
| broadway | brooklyn | broadway is under the J train, which is the slowest and screechiest train. they've also been doing construction work on the train, for which they put up these huge metal sheets that block out the sky from the street almost completely. broadway is the only long street in the area that runs straight into manhattan, so it's crowded. myrtle broadway is a particularly fun intersection.
| myrtle ave | brooklyn | myrtle ave runs through many fun places, such as pratt and ridgewood and myrtle broadway and forest park. it is very straight and a good walk. i just wish the bus on it was better.
