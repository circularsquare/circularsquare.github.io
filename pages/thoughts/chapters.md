i've noticed that my life seems to follow four year chapters. each chapter sort of looks like a year itself.

the [first year](/thoughts/winter) is [aloneness](/thoughts/aloneness), wandering, and penance.

the second year is struggle, study, and growth.

the third year is [connection](/friends), fluency, and creation.

the fourth year is comfort, pride, and [waiting](/thoughts/time).

as of writing, i am in my fifth chapter. i think i can make out what the sixth will be, but we'll see it goes.
