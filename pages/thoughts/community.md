community is something that i did not have for a long time. it was in reach, but i did not reach for it. out of fear of rejection and also slightly out of fear of [normalness](/thoughts/normalness). though in most ways, being part of community usually makes you much less normal. [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum) talks about parasocial relationships. my relationship to community is mostly parasocial, i think.

when visiting one of [heuchera](/friends/heuchera)'s friends, i discovered a very vivid community. chrysanthemum called it a "cabal". the apartment is furnished with a large dog bed that is suspiciously free of fur. 

i decided that i like community.
