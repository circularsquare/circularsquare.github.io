community is something that i don't really have. it's within reach, but i don't reach for it. out of fear of rejection and also slightly out of fear of [normalness](/thoughts/normalness). though honestly, if i was to join community, the "normal" i would be would not be that normal anyways.

chrysanthemum talks about parasocial relationships. i suppose i am parasocially part of community, which is maybe good enough.
