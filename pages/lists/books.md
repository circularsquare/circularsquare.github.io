- dream of polar fog - 8/10
    - a tribe in chukotka and a canadian man who joins them. very beautiful. feels authentic and true to that land, though i wouldn't know.
- the power broker - 6/10
    - very informative. i loved listening to it while walking around new york city, seeing the places that these politicians fought over.
- paradise - 8/10
    - when i read this, i had the thought that i would not have understood this book as andrew. 
- organ meats - 5/10
    - a wonderful surreal mess of words. i unfortunately identify with anita (the character in the book). involves red string and body construction.
- inverted world - 7/10
    - about a city on rails. its pacing is very good, and its world is original and scientifically deeply disturbing.
- three body problem - 10/10
    - the part in the 3rd book about the future society where there's only women really stuck with me. the portrayal of the consequences is super sexist but i like it
- exhalation - 8/10
    - scifi short story collection. recommended to me by [gingko](/friends/gingko). compact packages of mind-blowing worlds!
- collected schizophrenias - 5/10
    - a very relatable perspective on being crazy. [chrsyanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum) doesn't like this book because she shares too many characteristics with the author.
- dune - 8/10
    - i am the muad'dib
    - i did not like the books after the first one.
- lord of the rings - 10/10
- city of quartz - 7/10
    - it explains everything i ever wondered about los angeles. it's very easy to follow too. i've never gotten this far into a long history book except with the power broker, which i audiobooked.
- stag dance - 6/10
    - the book has several short stories which cover various aspects and incarnations of [community](/thoughts/community), some of which are very distant to me and interesting.
- canticle for leibowitz - 9/10
    - very cool. [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum) gave me this book. it's a science fiction book. it changed my view on christianity favorably and drastically. i wish i could talk about it with [aloe](friends/aloe).
