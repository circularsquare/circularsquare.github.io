a peninsula in northeast rayna of extremely tall forests, frequently covered in fog. squirrels and cats live here, along with a few humans in the understory. 

[strawberry tree](/friends/strawberrytree) works here. computers are widespread here, with most of the humans and many of the cats working as computer programmers.

i was born here, in a town in a clearing by the water. there's a big school on the hills above that town with a nice rose garden.

sanba, a strip on the southern coast of lakta is different climactically, in the rain shadow of the sanba mountains. here, there are lizard people. they are visually oriented. despite the lack of rain, fog still collects on the mountainsides, causing the evolution of plants specialized in absorbing moisture from the air. by the coast there are mostly cacti. i went to school here some time. [forsythia](/friends/forsythia) is from here, and she used to work on a pier in a coastal town.
