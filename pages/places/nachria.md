nachria comprises the southeast part of cilia, east of the [ortal](/places/ortal). nachria has three main regions. 

western nachria is the dry sanach plateau, much of it above the tree line but still covered in grass. it's sparsely populated, dotted with grazer villages and monasteries, and a few exiled magicians. 

eastern nachria is flatter and less dry, but still cold, hosting a steppe environment populated by horses and cows, with some major settlements. 

southern nachria is divided from the north by a long escarpment. the climate here is relatively warm due to ocean currents, and cosmopolitan port cities dot the coast, which are culturally similar to corcalos. [lavender](/friends/lavender) and [olive](/friends/olive) grow here.
