nachria comprises the southeast part of cilia, east of the [ortal](/places/ortal). nachria has three main regions. 

western nachria is the dry sanach plateau, much of it above the tree line but still covered in grass. it's sparsely populated, dotted with grazer villages and monasteries, and a few exiled magicians. 

northeast nachria is flatter and less dry, but still cold, hosting a steppe environment populated by horses and cows, with some major settlements. 

southeast nachria is divided from the rest by a long escarpment. the climate here is relatively warm due to ocean currents, and cosmopolitan port cities dot the coast.
