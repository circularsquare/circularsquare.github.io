seybrook is a town on an eponymous brook, across the river from [lindor](/places/lindor). 

there are many big buildings in seybrook. the town was initially centered around a big mill. as lindor grew, more and more industry was set up in seybrook, and the products were floated down the brook to the markets in lindor. the people of seybrook match the buildings in a way.

i moved here in 2025 with [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrsyanthemum). we live on a busy street paralleling the brook, along which many people and wagons travel.
