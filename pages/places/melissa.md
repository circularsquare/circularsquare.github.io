melissa is a long, relatively flat region on the west coast of cilia, in the foothills of the ortal mountains. much of the land is a series of alluvial plains. it has a oceanic climate, with cool summers. many humans live here. the land is fertile, and it serves as the breadbasket of cilia. 

the river valleys serve as important conduits of communication and trade, within melissa and up into fuun and nachria. the two longest are the krishe and the [lindje](/places/lindje).

i live here.
