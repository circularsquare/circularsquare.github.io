is wide.

every morning, groups of old chinese people do taichi. i wonder if some day i'll be there with them?

the bridges rise into the sky. they look a little steampunklike, with wires dangling hundreds of feet from the beige criss crossing beams. they rumble like huge animals.

the water washes away

all the dirt

all the people

all of my thoughts

### the southern park

this opened very recently after a lot of construction work was done on it. the rolling fields and clean lines kind of remind me of la noscea. they also remind me of another park with windswept willows farther north, along the perendim river. there's a segment of this park that's dark at night. it's only in that sort of darkness that i feel most comfortable. (when i'm at home, i'm too aware of myself to be comfortable, and when i'm outside during the day, i'm too aware of others.)

### the northern park

this is now closed for construction. but it was also very nice. one day there was fog covering the whole river, and standing at the edge of the water i could only see about 10 meters away. on another nice day, i was with [gingko](/friends/gingko) for the first time. it was gently drizzling. she had an umbrella but the rain felt nice. we looked at the moss underneath us. people often gathered in this park and play music. there were also some people playing quidditch in a soccer field. one time i was looking for rocks in this park to put in my aquarium and plants, but i found no rocks.
