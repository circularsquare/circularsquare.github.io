sanba is a strip of [lakta](/places/lakta) in the rain shadow of the sanba mountains. here, there are lizard people. they have vertical eyes to help with vision in different light levels, and they are generally visually oriented. despite the lack of rain, fog still collects on the mountainsides, causing the evolution of plants specialized in absorbing moisture from the air. by the coast there are mostly cacti. 

i went to school here some time, where i met [azalea](/places/azalea). also [forsythia](/friends/forsythia) is from here, and she used to work on a pier in a coastal town.
