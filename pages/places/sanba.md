sanba is a strip of [lakta](/places/lakta) in the rain shadow of the sanba mountains. here, there are lizard people. they have vertical eyes to help with vision in different light levels, and they are generally visually oriented. despite the lack of rain, fog collects on the mountainsides, causing the evolution of plants specialized in absorbing moisture from the air. by the coast there are mostly cacti. 

i went to school here some time, where i met [azalea](/friends/azalea), and i saw but did not yet meet [clementine](/friends/clementine). also [forsythia](/friends/forsythia) is from here, and she used to work on a pier in a coastal town. 

the mountain near my school is snow capped in the winter. my first roommate biked up the mountain road every few weeks. i wanted to go too. i made many attempts, each of which got me slightly closer to god, but never quite halfway up the mountain. there was a small valley part of the way up with a stream, the only one i've ever seen in sanba. i liked to sit there and watch it trickle. 

there are several schools there, each a monastery. mine worshipped [ugliness](/thoughts/beauty). clementine's worshipped
