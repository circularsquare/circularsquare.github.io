clouds is a place near [lindor](/places/lindor) with three main settlements.
- cirrus in the east, by the [lindje](/places/lindje)
- [stratus](/places/stratus) in the north
- nimbus in the south

#### stratus
has its own [page](/places/stratus).

#### nimbus
is a busy crossroads by the water. trains running to [lindor](/places/lindor) pass through here. in south nimbus, there are little islands of sand and grass, home to many seagulls. 

#### cirrus
is a town near lindor, once defined by its bridges across the lindje. lately, many young people have been moving here, granting it a sleek vibe that somehow still feels a bit hollow. but it'll be okay with some time.
