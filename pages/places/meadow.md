is where i grew up. 

the meadows are in north-central melissa, on the east bank of the [lindje](/places/lindje). it's quite open, and the sky is big enough that you really do feel the weather, but not so big that you necessarily fear it. there are many places within the meadows...
 
#### downtown
people from all over come here for food. i particularly like one place that has hot pot, with as many mushrooms and vegetables as you want. i overeat often here.

#### the park
there is a big lake here that always has turtles and birds in it. there is a nesting goose on one side. 

in another part of the park, there's a forest. it feels magical when covered in snow. one time, i was walking through the snow covered forest with [watercress](/friends/watercress) and we found hanging from a tree a photograph of partially naked men doing something. it was interesting. in other seasons, this forest is so full of life. the canopy is thick and nearly complete.

there is also a field of tall grass. they grow around 8 feet high, and in the fall, they yellow and make wonderful sounds. when they are grown, the world outside disappears. there is a cluster of trees in the center that form a hideaway, shaded. kids sometimes go here in the summer to smoke.
