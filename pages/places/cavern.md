title: the kozuloa cavern
permalink: /places/cavern/
---

is an endless network, on a small island off the coast of melissa. parts of it are made of extremely large crystals, which can sometimes look like oceans. 

many people try to mine here for gemstones, and they often find what they're looking for. there are so many crevices that it's not too hard to end up somewhere no one has been before. the main risk is getting lost. there are not so many exits. i work in the cave.

interestingly, the deeper parts of the cave are no less lively than the parts closer to the surface. tucked into the walls are lots of high end restaurants. many porters are required to carry the food down to be prepared for the miners, who discuss technique and trade agreements under crystal chandeliers and over fancy meats.
