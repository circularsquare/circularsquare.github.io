jornor is a town on the [lindje](/places/lindje), upstream of [lindor](/places/lindor). as trade has recently flourished between the two settlements, jornor has been growing, but it's a relatively new town. i dislike it here, because it's hard to get around.

[hydrangea](/friends/hydrangea) lives at the foot of a hill in the hinterlands of jornor, where they have a big house. [aloe](/friends/aloe) lives slightly further out, in a rural area. he has many chickens there, and he grows corn and pumpkins. [honeysuckle](/friends/honeysuckle) and [hydrangea](/friends/hydrangea) often go to visit, and sometimes they bring me eggs and vegetables.

[clementine](/friends/clementine) is from jornor, and likes it, but when i complain about it she struggles to defend it, which i find funny.[sundew](/friends/sundew) and [plum](/friends/plum) used to work in downtown jornor in a sparkling new building, but they've since moved to [lindor](/places/lindor).

jornor has many small forested mountain ranges running through it. the mountains are ancient, and have flat tops. the forests here are covered in wood with many textures: like glass, like braided dough, like a golgi apparatus, like CD grooves covered in moss. and the stone has many textures, like wood, like a brick road, like a wet sandcastle collapsing. there's a mountain near [aloe](/friends/aloe)'s house that is a particularly nice hike.
