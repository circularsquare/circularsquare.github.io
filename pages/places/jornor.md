jornor is a town on the [lindje](/places/lindje), upstream of [lindor](/places/lindor). as trade has recently flourished between the two settlements, jornor has been growing, but it's a relatively new town. i dislike it here, because it's hard to get around.

[hydrangea](/friends/hydrangea) lives at the foot of a hill in the hinterlands of jornor, where they have a big house. [aloe](/friends/aloe) lives slightly further out, in a rural area. he has many chickens there, and he grows corn and pumpkins. [honeysuckle](/friends/honeysuckle) and [hydrangea](/friends/hydrangea) often go to visit, and sometimes they bring me eggs and vegetables.

[sundew](/friends/sundew) and [plum](/friends/plum) used to work in downtown jornor in a sparkling new building, but they've since moved to [lindor](/places/lindor).
