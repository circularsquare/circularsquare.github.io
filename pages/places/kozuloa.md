kozuloa is a network of caverns, on a small rocky island just off the coast of [melissa](/places/melissa). the primary entrance is a wide hole quarried through the thick layers of shale, which replaced the previous winding route. staircases and lifts run along the surface of the hole. overlooking the island is a tall steel mast used to move heavy equipment in and out of the entrance.

parts of the caverns are made of extremely large crystals, which can sometimes look like oceans. many people try to mine here for gemstones, and they often find what they're looking for. there are so many crevices that it's not too hard to end up somewhere no one has been before. the most common outcome is getting lost. there are not so many exits. 

interestingly, the deeper parts of the caves are no less lively than the parts closer to the surface. tucked into the walls are lots of high end restaurants. many porters are required to carry the food down to be prepared for the miners, who discuss technique and trade agreements under crystal chandeliers and over fancy meats. there is effort expended to make these discussions appear friendly. when people leave kozuloa, they do so quietly and quickly. 

i worked in the caves for one chapter of my life. so have many of my [friends](/friends).
