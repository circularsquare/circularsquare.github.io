fulan is one of the two mouse kingdoms, along with [shonei](/places/shonei). it is a mostly low lying area punctuated by pockets of limestone hills. it is warm and floods fairly regularly. there are many large shallow lakes along the rivers, providing a livelihood for many fishermice. 

compared to shonei, the people of fulan are a bit smaller physically, and much more receptive to the outside world. they follow a complex shamanistic religion. technically, fulan and shonei have been at war for 46 years, though in the past decades the armed skimishes have died down and the armistice line has remained stable. 

the gardens of fulan are world-renowned. the fulani build vast walled garden complexes, filled by nobles with their exotic botanical collections.

my parents are from here, and so is [chrsyanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum).
