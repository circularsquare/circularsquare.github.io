shonei is a game i am working on sporadically.

it's a side view base building game. you control a group of mice that have set out to establish a settlement on the frontiers in the vast mouse confederation of [shonei](/places/shonei). these mice have capitalist tendencies and endless material desire. to satisfy them and expand, a settlement must specialize in a few efficient production chains, trading for the goods that can't be produced at home on a centralized player market. 

i'm pretty bad at coding (and staying attentive while coding) so i might write a sort of "wiki" here that describes my plans for systems i will hopefully implement. but right now there is just a skeleton:

- [mouse](mouse)


in the future, i want to work on a game called celia where you play as a mushroom who awakens under a tree. directly near the roots of the tree is safe, but farther out, toxin limits where you can go, which is produced by an aerial bacteria of unknown origin. by meeting and befriending other fungus species, you will be able to merge your mycorhizal networks, and your minds/souls. species will grant the ability to construct different specialized structures, allowing more complex actions such as humidification or nitrogen fixation, which will expand your reach. your eventual goal is to bring the bacteria population under control and remove most of the toxin, which will allow biodiversity to return.
