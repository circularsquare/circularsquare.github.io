azalea is a type of rhododendron, which is a type of heath (erica). 

shimmering burning cellophane pink, 

in his light i am able to remember that i am real. it makes the world larger and more real. a type of color not representable on computer screens. his voice pierces the clouds in heat and clarity

we went to school in [sanba](/places/lakta) together, where we sang in small piano rooms. 

i'm sorry for being impatient when you were following me. i really regret it. i am so grateful that you let me follow you back today.

we are now in a chorus together!
