jasmine is a vine/shrub in the olive family with sweet smelling flowers. it grows throughout fulan and shonei. 

i think jasmine is the best smell in the world. at college i would often go on walks and take branches of jasmine and stick them in a bottle in my window. this eventually lured in a carpenter bee who drilled into my bed frame and settled there. 

jasmine is [community](/thoughts/community). she's one of [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum)'s friends, and i've heard of her mostly through chrysanthemum, who talks about her all the time, though they maybe shouldn't. jasmine lives in a small town in fuun, where she works for a newspaper. she is very principled. and very pretty.
