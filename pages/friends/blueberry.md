blueberry is a shrub in the heather family native to northern [melissa](/places/melissa). it produces berries that are purpleish blue. the plant is related to cranberry and [azalea](/friends/azalea) and other heaths.

blueberry is sister of [olive](/friends/olive) and daughter of [hydrangea](/friends/hydrangea).
