freesia is a family of funnel shaped flowers in iridaceae that grows in the coastal mountains of fulan. it has a really nice sweet citrusy smell that i often use in my essential oil diffuser.

she enters your life, a light in a dress, and for a second you're sure that no person has ever disliked her. her petals illuminate you.

where does the light come from? i think she receives it from others, bounces it back and forth inside like a laser, and sends it out brighter than it was. a delicate balance of an operation, one she watches over vigilantly. she works in the [cave](/places/cavern), and provides light of a different type from the crystals.
