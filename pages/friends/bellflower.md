bellflower is an herbaceous plant that grows in the mountains and fields of melacca. it has blue-purple flowers and edible roots. it can survive down to -40 degrees!

bellflower is a skilled painter. i think their mind occupies a different place from mine. they also used to be christian. they're attentive, and very strong when they decide to be, but more often they are willing to go wherever the wind takes them. 

they live in south [seybrook](/places/seybrook) and have a lot of artist friends. bellflower likes milk tea and whipped cream and sweet fermented rice.
