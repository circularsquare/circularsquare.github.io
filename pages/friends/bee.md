bee is a flying insect that eats nectar and pollen. it is fat and sometimes big and always adorable. it has yellow stripes. bee is a great pollinator, and can see ultraviolet. it loves most flowers, but especially purple and numerous ones like mint and coleus. 

some believe that there are multiple bees, but i find the [one bee universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe) theory more compelling. every instance of bee is just the same bee travelling through time. this explains why some times bee looks bigger and fatter than others.

i first got to know bee when in [sanba](/places/sanba) i left my window open the whole year, with [jasmine](/friends/jasmine) branches in a bottle on the windowsill. bee entered and started drilling into the wood of my bed. i heard her digging away directly under my pillow. over the course of a few months, she made a home. but then i graduated and left. 

in my garden in [seybrook](/places/seybrook) i have wisteria and virginia creeper. bee came back, even fatter this time, and as three. here, she chews circles out of the soft leaves and makes nests out of them. i'm not sure where the nests are, but there sure are a lot of circles.

in my room i also have an extra fat and very soft form of bee flying in the air. she looks quite distinct. i believe it might be something approaching her final form.
