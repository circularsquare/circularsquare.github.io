chrsyanthemum is a genus in asteraceae that comes in many colors and makes great tea.

chrsyanthemum is a writer. they've lived in a lot of places. 

they perpetually sound like they're in a state of disorientation and panic, but it's unclear to me why. when around them i feel calm, maybe because it's nice to be around someone who's this way. [pine](friends/pine) is also this way. chrysanthemum is very mentally present and nimble and has probably read three million books. i think they're probably a genius or something. all of their friends and dates have been trans women, which for some reason makes them anxious
