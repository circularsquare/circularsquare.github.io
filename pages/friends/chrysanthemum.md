chrsyanthemum is a genus in asteraceae that comes in many colors and makes great tea.

chrsyanthemum is a writer. they like other writers, but only if they're good, which apparently they usually aren't. now that we are roommates in [seybrook](/places/seybrook), they leave a lot of silly notes and put a lot of "printed matter" on the wall, which is nice. 

they've lived in a lot of places. they're originally from a very old city in [fulan](/places/fulan) called gufu, which is known for its canals, sweet food, and elitism. chrysanthemum thinks that everyone from outside gufu is a barbarian. we visited gufu once, and walked around gardens as princesses. chrysanthemum has also grown in malacca and fuun.

chrysanthemum has introduced me to "[community](/thoughts/community)" so that i can become normal. 

chrysanthemum often sounds like they're in a state of disorientation. when around them i feel calm, maybe because it's nice to be around someone who's this way. [pine](friends/pine) is also this way. 

chrysanthemum is very mentally present and nimble and has probably read three million books. i think they're probably a genius or something. all of their friends and dates have been trans women, which for some reason makes them anxious. they are not physically nimble though, and describes themself as "agility 0".

chrysanthemum sometimes grows in scary ways, impossible to contain. when they get like this, it is when they are doing their best work, i think. it's beautiful, and i'm impressed at their ability to handle themselves. they blame this part of themself on their mother wormwood. i'm here for you if ever you need it.

talking to chrysanthemum can be overwhelming. i don't necessarily see each little petal, but i feel their sum and it's wonderful.
