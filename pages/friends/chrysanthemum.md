chrsyanthemum is a genus in asteraceae that comes in many colors and makes great tea.

chrsyanthemum is a writer. they've lived in a lot of places. they like other writers, but only if they're good, which apparently they usually aren't. now that we are roommates in [seybrook](/places/seybrook), they leave a lot of silly notes and put a lot of "printed matter" on the wall, which is nice.

they often sound like they're in a state of disorientation. when around them i feel calm, maybe because it's nice to be around someone who's this way. [pine](friends/pine) is also this way. 

chrysanthemum is very mentally present and nimble and has probably read three million books. i think they're probably a genius or something. all of their friends and dates have been trans women, which for some reason makes them anxious.

when i talk to them, i don't necessarily see each little petal, but i feel their sum and it's wonderful.
