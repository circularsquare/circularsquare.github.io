gingko is a tree with fan shaped leaves which turn a beautiful homogenous gold in the fall. lots of fruits fall from the gingkos right outside my past home by the [lindje](/places/river). gingko is native to [lakta](/places/lakta), but the one i know well is from [nachria](/places/nachria).

gingko likes tea and has a soft voice and a soft face. she has very small handwriting and sometimes sends letters to people. 

sometimes we walked in the morning to the [cavern](/places/kozuloa). how did we end up here?

you exist in the world. you talk about distant events and people. when you take my mind to these places i feel as if i'm in the world too, which is a nice feeling to have.

you're a builder. does it feel good to make something that people use? you're inspiring. what would it take for me to become a builder too?

looking back, i met you when i was softest... when i was most wary of the world. if it was anyone but you, maybe i would have been stuck there forever.
