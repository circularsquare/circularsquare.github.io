sundew (drosera) is a carnivorous plant. the thin green leaves have red hairs that it coats in a liquid that captures and digests gnats and other little bugs.

he's really funny. i'm often not sure where your mind is, in a good way. he used to work in the [cave](/places/cavern) with me but he left and is roaming about, meeting all sorts of people.

when we were in school, you felt so much smaller. or did i just feel bigger?

the sundew i have in my home died, but it did so after flowering. after a dormant period (6 months?) the seeds sprouted into new sundews!
