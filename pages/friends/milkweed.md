milkweed is a plant that has milky latex and grows bunches of many small flowers that monarch butterflies like to eat from. 

he's my first friend i met in the caves. he used to put water bottles on my head. i really enjoy talking with him because he can detach his mind from his body, and while that's something that normally makes me cautious, with milkweed it's beautiful. he tilts his chin up a bit and the tiny pink flowers flare open in quick succession, painting a picture. he's also kinda clumsy, probably because it's hard to coordinate your body when you're detached.

he knows an infinite amount of information about sports.
