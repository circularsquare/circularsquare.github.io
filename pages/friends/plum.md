is a type of tree, closely related to peaches and cherries. in the spring they fill up with bright pink papery petals.

when i'm with you, it feels ok to leave the world.

plum is very easygoing and makes friends easily. he used to work as an event organizer. he also likes putting me into boxes, like [sundew](/friends/sundew). when i speak with him, it feels so natural that it almost feels like we're just thinking in each others heads. this is in contrast to when i speak with strangers which feels precarious. plum is a conversational wizard. upon meeting him, [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum) was immediately struck by how nice he is. 

sometimes i visit plum's place. it faces west and is on the 5th floor, so in the afternoon the sun always shines into the room and floods the floor. i like to lie on it. plum, being a very cold hardy plant, doesn't like this and usually keeps the window open, even in winter sometimes. plum's heat capacity is truly an enigma.

he went to school in southern fuun, and i visited there once. it was very snowy, and the food they had was very good. 

we also visited corcoros and nachria together. we walked along a silent path to a lighthouse, illuminated only by the orange full moon. while skinny dipping under the lighthouse i saw the big dipper for the first time, and i felt good in the universe.
