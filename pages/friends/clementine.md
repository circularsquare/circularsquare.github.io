clementine is a hybrid of mandarin and orange, a tree that bears fruit in the winter. they're grown in relatively warm climates, like lakta and coastal fulan.

the first time i met clementine she opened her bag and pulled out a bag of like 15 clementines. we ate some. i went to school in [lakta](/places/lakta) near clementine at the same time, but we never met there.  

clementine is the most attentive and empathetic person i know. sometimes it feels like she's joined you behind your eyes, even when you're just texting.

clementine is a "small baller".
