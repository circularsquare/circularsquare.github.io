clementine is a hybrid of mandarin and orange, a tree that bears fruit in the winter. they're grown in relatively warm climates, like lakta and coastal fulan.

the first time i met clementine she opened her bag and pulled out a bag of like 15 clementines. we ate some. i went to school in [lakta](/places/lakta) near clementine at the same time, but we never met there.  

clementine is the most attentive and empathetic person i know. sometimes it feels like she's joined you behind your eyes, even when you're just texting. she's also an artist, and uses this fine control of attention to see things from rare angles.

clementine is almost never [alone](/thoughts/alone). but even so, there was a long period when she was sad. this confused me, and it confused her too. after returning, she told me that there was no cause. it was simply [momentum](/thoughts/momentum). and by simply refusing to be sad, she banished it. it was then that i recognized my [shame](/thoughts/shame) as another product of momentum, and resolved to banish it.

clementine is a baller.
