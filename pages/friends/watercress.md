is a plant that grows in streams, and grows very quickly. it's related to radish and wasabi. the leaves are fresh and a bit peppery!

she's a writer at heart. she loves music and has wide eyes. 

we did volunteer events together. we discovered the city together. we grew up together. such good times! we also went to the park very often, on a few times to walk the dog, who i remember always being very licky and hyper and nice to feel. we walked in the woods in the corner of the park too, one time when it was snowing, and saw a picture hanging from a tree that i think will be stuck in my memory forever.

now, she's studying to be a doctor near the [meadow](/places/meadow). she often comes to [seybrook](/places/seybrook) to go to music performances though.
