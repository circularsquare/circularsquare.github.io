are my babies!

they are gray and were born around dec 2021. they kinda look the same, but nanachi has a vertical line on her forehead.

nanachi is probably the older sister. she always wants to explore! if i ever leave my bedroom door open she is instantly at it. she likes being on high places like my laundry hamper. she also is very willing to try new foods, and spends a lot of time outside the pen searching for things. one of the foods she has found is hay that has fallen into the radiator, which i guess is roasted so it has a different taste.

mitty is shy and often second to do things. she is a bit softer than nanachi, and likes to be pet a lot. when i take her onto the couch for nail clipping, she is very relaxed and doesn't move much, maybe because she remembers that she'll get a treat at the end. she is often content staying in the hay area and eating hay. she also often tries to hide her face in nanachi's butt, but they both do this to some extent.

at my last home in [the valley](/places/lindor), they roam around my room, which is like 30% occupied by bunny pen, which sits under my lofted bed. they spend maybe half their time in the pen and half outside. they like sleeping in the pen but when they're active at morning or evening they run around a lot outside, and in the afternoon they often lounge around outside. 

they eat mostly hay and i buy them celery/cucumbers/bell pepper. they also get fallen leaves / prunings of the random plants that i grow. they like to eat coleus which is fortunate because it drops so many leaves! also jasmine leaves/flowers and watercress and stringy sedum. they also get a handful of pellets in the evening which they go crazy for. i don't really get why? the ingredients says it's just hay and soy meal, and some vitamins. this is one of the things i don't think i'll ever understand about bunnies.

when i plank sometimes they go inside my shirt and it feels super fuzzy and nice.

if they were plants (which is a ridiculous idea, since they are bunnies and not plants), then mitty would be mimosa pudica and nanachi would be purslane. 

mimosa pudica, also known as sensitive plant, has leaves that close quickly when touched. it has thorns and fluffy pink flowers. it's native to [lakta](/places/lakta). 

purslane is a quick growing plant with round leaves that spreads seeds everywhere. it's edible, and its tart leaves are sometimes used in salads.
