aloe is a succulent plant with no stem and very thick leaves that are jelly-like inside. 

aloe is from a small village in [fulan](/places/fulan) where they grow rice and peanuts. one neighboring village raises a lot of chickens.

aloe can speak to animals, especially birds. when he whistles it's usually too loud for birds though, and it scares them away, but if they're far enough away it doesn't seem as loud to them. 

aloe was an electrical engineer. he had a big box of wires and diodes and lights and solder. he later started working with software. he tried to teach me how to code, but he used C. when he tried to explain what a public static void was, it just scared me away.

aloe is [beautiful](/thoughts/beauty) and not [normal](/thoughts/normalness).

aloe is always there.

aloe never leaves.

please
