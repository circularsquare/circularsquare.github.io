honeysuckle is a vine native to [fulan](/places/fulan) that produces sweetly scented flowers. the flowers attract several types of moths and hummingbirds. 

honeysuckle is a vigorous grower and a relentless negotiator. like [hydrangea](/friends/hydrangea) in this respect.  according to [chrysanthemum](/friends/chrysanthemum), this is why i'm autistic.

she loves to explore the city, browsing stores. she used to take me along to empty houses, where we would work in empty rooms.
