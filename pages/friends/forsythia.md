is in the olive family. it's one of the first things to bloom near where i live.

she is mystical and inspiring. forsythia wants to fuck god. forsythia wants to eat the world.

her eyes burn with a passion and disdain that makes others feel the same.

she is from a beach town in [sanba](/places/lakta), but has gone to southern [shonei](/places/shonei) to teach, and may go again.

i don't think i've ever met someone with such control of their own body. she enters and leaves it like wind through branches. she would probably be good at parkour.
