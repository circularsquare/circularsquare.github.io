a secret about me is that [i](..) really love bunnies. 

i have 2 bunnies. one is named [nanachi](/friends/nanachimitty) and one is [mitty](/friends/nanachimitty).

they are very soft, and their softest spot is right behind the ears. their fur is sometimes lighter in this area. they don't like being touched there. i think that's a fairly consistent pattern: things that are nice to touch do not like being touched.
