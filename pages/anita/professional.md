i've been a trader since 2022.

in college i studied physics, math, and cs, and graduated in 2022.

in 2021, i did my senior thesis on recoil in viscoelastic materials. when you stretch out a viscoelastic material and let go, how does the impulse travel down the material? how do the material properties determine the amount of energy and power you can get out of the recoil? how have animals evolved to optimize these parameters? these sorts of questions.

in 2020, i did a project where we found systematic defects in silicon wafers. we used fourier transforms to find repeated defects and clutering algorithms to find smudges and blobs, and some other techniques for other stuff.

lately i mostly make maps in my free time. check out my [projects](/projects)!
